Let's learn some node.js

I wanted to learn some node, so I used Socket.io, Jade, and Express. To run make sure you have all of these dependencies!

===========

sudo npm install socket.io jade express

============

use homebrew to install node:

============

brew install node

============

or if not:

git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git

===============
cd node
./configure
make
sudo make install
===================


I will be writing an article explaining how this works @ gcgomez.com (under the blog section)

This will be part of a bigger project: an open source real time conference online code editor
