Codify
============

Let's learn some node.js

This is a real time chat application in node.js. Beginner stuff, I know, but it's a start.

I wanted to learn some node, so I used Socket.io, Jade, and Express. To run make sure you have all of these dependencies!


sudo npm install socket.io jade express

============

use homebrew to install node:


brew install node

============

or if not:

git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git

===============
cd node
./configure
make
sudo make install




===================


I will be writing an article explaining how this works @ gcgomez.com (under the blog section)

This will be part of a bigger project: an open source real time conference online code editor.

Ever had a problem with getting help with coding? Codify will change that. You can chat, video or text,
while real-time analyzing and editing code. Let's see how this goes.

Anyone is, as always, welcome to provide input and code!
